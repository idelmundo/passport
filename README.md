  ## Project title 
  Reverse Engineering Code passport. 
  <hr>

  ## Description 
  We were asked to reverse engineer a passport.js and understand what its doing line by line. We would have to explain it to a person who doesn't know what the code is doing. This app allows users to create an account, have a login username and password stored in mysql database. For example when we login to our email such as google we have email and password where its always save is knows as secret pw and it will always be the same pw.

  ## First step 
  Let see this app in action lets clone this repostory to you computer by opening our terminal or bash (PC user) git clone and paste the to your terminal. 2. open terminal and lets download "npm i" "i" shortcut for install. These will install all the nodes in the packages. 3. Lets run "node server.js" you will see this connect to our local server which is 8080. 4. Lets open the web brower and enter http://localhost:8080 in the search bar.

  ## Lets go through each folder 
  Lets begin with server.js since that makes more sense because thats what were going to use to commincate with all the files and browser. Line 2-4 these are depedency think of it like a child that depends on its parents, application the depend on other code. Line 5 is pretty much saying this will be needed in the folder called config/passport. Line 8 and 9 is our env.port that can be heroku server or local server such as "8080,3000" and other server port. It is important to have the port in CAPITAL because we are letting other programmer not the change this. In line 9 we re saying that this will be seen in ./model folder.
